	Questions

1.	Which is the basic difference between the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) and RMI?
RPC (Remote Procedure Call) and RMI (Remote Method Invocation) are two mechanisms that allow the user to invoke or call processes
that will run on a different computer from the one the user is using. The main difference between the two is the approach or paradigm used.
RMI uses an object oriented paradigm where the user needs to know the object and the method of the object he needs to invoke.
In comparison, RPC isn’t object oriented and doesn’t deal with objects. Rather, it calls specific subroutines that are already established.

2.	Which is the difference between the methods Naming.bind and Naming.rebind?
Naming.bind - cannot be raplace later
Naming.rebind - can be replace later

3.	Is it possible to start programmatically the registry? If yes, which is the difference between starting it manually and starting it programmatically?
4.	If the client of an RMI object is on another machine then where the object, the stub and skeleton code will run?
Pe Client: interface, stub class and client program.
Pe server: interface, implemented class server program, stub class and skeleton class

5.	What is wrong in the next remote interface definition:
	public interface PerfectTimeI extends Remote {
  	     long getPerfectTime();
        }
Orice metoda din interfata care extinde Remote interface trebuie sa aiba:
  throws RemoteException

	Problems

1.	Write a code snippet for a client side lookup of an arbitrary remote interface.
See RMI package.

2.	Write the remote interface and the implementation class for a remote object which provides the possibility to authorize a user
using an id and a password, also provide the registration code of the remote object. The authorization should succeed always for simplicity.
